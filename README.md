# Serotonin environment types
Type definitions for Serotonin's Lua VM

## What is this?
This project provides easy to use type definitions for Serotonin's Lua VM. This project allows for better type checking & thus better productivity when writing scripts inside of Visual Studio Code when using the Luau Language Server. 

## Setup
- Install the [Luau Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.luau-lsp) extension in Visual Studio Code.
- Take the type definitions from [here](https://github.com/loud2pro/serotonin-type-defs/tree/main/types) and configure the Luau Language Server extension to use these types. ([Example](https://github.com/loud2pro/serotonin-type-defs/tree/main/example/))

## Contributing
If you find any missing definitions or issues with the definitions, feel free to submit a pull request and/or message me on Discord to let me know ([@videography](https://discord.com/users/1211097252790018104)). These type definitions are based off of the documentation provided [here](https://serotonin-1.gitbook.io/serotonin-docs).
